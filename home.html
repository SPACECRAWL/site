        a sci-fi roleplay group with an emphasis on user experience and storytelling.

          <div class="textboxheader"><p>Before the advent of GPS or the compass, people used stars as their guides in the night; 
              none were as valuable to early navigators as Polaris, an unmistakable fixed point just above Earth's north pole. 
              As the heavens swirled around it and the planet spun, that single bright star stayed still at the axis, 
              unmoving in its place, and mariners all over the hemisphere counted on it to discern their heading.
            <div style="height:1px;"></div>
            <p>Your ship's navigators have no Polaris to guide them today.
              All they have to look to for help are foreign skies dotted with nameless constellations, 
              and the mocking, inky void of space, endless and yawning and all around you.
            <div style="height:1px;"></div>
            <p>The crew is motley and ragged, their once shining eyes now heavy with exhaustion, 
              their nails bitten and their hands covered in blisters. This may have been your first assignment, or
              maybe it was your last before a well-earned retirement; regardless of how experienced you are, 
              how prepared you might've been to face the worst, no one could've expected what would become of your mission, 
              and no one could've possibly prevented it.
            <div style="height:1px;"></div>
            <p>You find yourself lost in unknown territory, stranded by a spacial anomaly on the other side of the galaxy. 
              Together with your crewmates, you struggle for survival and prosperity in the deadly expanse of space, 
              looking for something that might reunite you with what you've left behind.

                Hello everyone! This is still a HUGE work in progress! If you encounter any bugs with this prototype of a website, send in a note!
                Please keep in mind that while I don't plan on making it responsive to tiny viewports for desktop, I do plan on making a mobile version, because holy shit.
                <p></p>Also, that's a placeholder header image you're looking at there. Don't judge me. ... and also don't judge all that excess space below, okay, this place will be packed with stuff soon.
