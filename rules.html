        <div class="titlebox">GENERAL RULES</div>
        <div class="boxbody"><p>If you have any uncertainties, questions, or concerns, 
            or if you have complaints about the conduct of someone else within the group, please contact an admin.

            <div class="divider"></div>

            <p><span class="numberspan">RULE 1.</span> Quite simply, the number one rule here is to <span class="highlight">be kind to your fellow 
            roleplayers.</span> Intentionally hurtful behaviors such as passive aggression and guilt-tripping are unacceptable, as we want this
            to be a friendly, positive environment. If you're feeling stressed out and don't know if you'll be able to stay civil, take a couple days off!
            
            <div class="divider"></div>

            <p><span class="numberspan">RULE 2.</span> Similarly, <span class="highlight">any form of bigotry won't be tolerated</span>;
            this includes and is not limited to racism, ableism, xenophobia, homophobia, transphobia, misogyny, or endorsement of such.
            In-universe, the oppressive institutions on 21st century Earth no longer exist, and characters who arbitrarily hold racist, 
            sexist and homophobic views won't be allowed.

            <div class="parasep"></div>

            While these themes have merit to be explored in fiction, I don't think a roleplay group like this one is the best
            place to do it, as it's a damper for those who're here to have fun and already have to deal with such things in real life.
            For this purpose, <span class="highlight">slurs may not be used in chat</span>, even if you can personally reclaim them.
            
            <div class="divider"></div>

            Characters are permitted to have strong opinions on alien species and alien practices, but these should not under any
            circumstance be treated as a parallel to real life human racism, and instead as the natural and inevitable friction and
            differences between beings from different solar systems.
            
            <div class="dividerpostp"></div>
                        
            <p><span class="numberspan">RULE 3.</span> Your roleplay partners will have lives outside of their hobby, and probably even have other 
            groups to attend to as well! When it comes to school, work, and other interests, people can be quite busy. You're okay to ping 
            people if it's been a bit since they've replied, etc etc, but the line is drawn when polite inquiry turns into hounding and pestering.
            
            <div class="divider"></div>
            
            <p><span class="numberspan">RULE 4.</span> As a roleplay staged on Discord, with DeviantART simply being a repository for artwork and a 
            means to find new members, all members <span class="highlight">must be in the group's Discord.</span> If a member leaves the Discord without 
            alerting an admin, it'll be seen as a loss of interest in the group, and your character will be archived (which is at any point reversible!). 
            If you need help muting the Discord server, or if there's anything else bothering you about the chat, please let an admin know 
            and we'll see what we can do!
            
            <div class="divider"></div>
            
            <p><span class="numberspan">RULE 5.</span> All members <span class="highlight">must be eighteen</span> years of age or older. 
            I'm not going to pretend like the campaign I'm running here will be particularly dark or need especial maturity, 
            but I still don't wish to handle the complications that might arise from a combination of minors and adults in the group. 
            Anyone found to be faking their age will be banned from the group altogether, even after they turn eighteen. 
            If you're a younger person looking to participate in the future, feel free to follow along until you're of age to join! 
            
            <div class="divider"></div>
            
            <p><span class="numberspan">RULE 6.</span> All art submitted to the group must be your own work, 
            save for your application art, which may be something someone else has drawn for you. SPACECRAWL will never discriminate based on the 
            talent of individual artists, and is mainly concerned with your ability as a writer and collaborative storyteller - application art is 
            just a quick and easy way to get the jist of your character's appearance, especially if they're nonhuman.
            
            <div class="divider"></div>
            
            <p><span class="numberspan">RULE 7.</span> <span class="highlight">Sexual content will not be allowed</span> in the group in any form, 
            because SPACECRAWL ... isn't that kind of community! This doesn't include mere mentions of it, nor does it include jokes or innuendos, 
            though we ask that juvenile humor be kept to a minimum. If someone is made uncomfortable by any such talk, they're completely within 
            their rights to ask that people change the topic.
        </div>
        
        <div class="boxdivider"></div>
        
        <div class="titlebox">CHARACTER RULES</div>
        <div class="boxbody">
            <p><span class="numberspan">RULE 8.</span> All characters must be the equivalent in their species of 
            <span class="highlight">twenty-one years old</span> or older. Playing children is not permitted, and no children or unenlisted civilians 
            are aboard the ship, even in the form of NPCs. Your characters are working in a military fleet!
            
            <div class="divider"></div>
            
            <p><span class="numberspan">RULE 9.</span> Members only start with the ability to make one character, 
            but can eventually purchase a second slot. Unwanted characters can be retired, meaning they'll become NPCs but stay on the ship, 
            or they can simply be killed off.
            
            <div class="parasep"></div>

            However, before you resort to such a thing, it's <span class="highlight">heavily suggested</span> that you try to understand 
            <i>why</i> you're having trouble meshing with your character, and think about what you could do to make playing them more enjoyable. 
            Staff are happy to help when it comes to a character in need of development!

            <div class="dividerpostp"></div>
            
            <p><span class="numberspan">RULE 10.</span> Roleplayers are not their characters! It's expected that you're able to maintain enough of 
            a separation from your character that you don't feel emotionally affected by IC conflict, and that you don't conflate a character's 
            actions or thoughts with those of their roleplayer.

            <div class="divider"></div>
            
            <p><span class="numberspan">RULE 11.</span> When it comes to your character's history and role in the world, there's no limit on
            what you're allowed to do, so long as it doesn't contradict anything already established. If you want to be the inventor of a sentient AI,
            the former very-important CEO of a ship repair company, or someone who spent their years studying a prolific invasive space-fungus on the 
            border of known space, then go for it!

            <div class="parasep"></div>

            You're free to invent entire civilizations, wars, historical events, locations, and technologies, so long as they do not unbalance the 
            general setting or call too much of the continuity into question (for example, if you describe a miraculous ship engine that can go 100x 
            faster than light, there's no reason it wouldn't be in widespread use throughout known space). Additionally, if you wish to implicate 
            a member-made alien species into your history, it might be wise to get their permission - they might even be able to give you a few 
            neat ideas!

            <div class="dividerpostbox"></div>
        </div>

        <div class="boxdivider"></div>
        
        <div class="titlebox">ROLEPLAY RULES</div>
        <div class="boxbody">
            <p><span class="numberspan">RULE 12.</span> <span class="highlight">The GM's decision is final.</span> 
            Please don't argue about outcomes or rulings you dislike, unless you truly feel they're unfair beyond a dislike of circumstance. 
            In tough scenarios, think about how you can turn it around for your character and take advantage of what you were given! 
                
            <div class="parasep"></div>

            In the campaign, your character will be given frequent challenges to overcome, designed to build their character and create 
            an interesting story - your success will stem from your creativity, ability to make the best of what you're given, and your interactions 
            with the other characters. If you want a roleplay where you'll never experience defeat or bad luck, then SPACECRAWL may not be the group 
            for you.
                                
            <div class="dividerpostp"></div>
            
            <p><span class="numberspan">RULE 13.</span> Godmodding is absolutely not allowed. You may not, at any time, dictate the actions of 
            another person's character, nor may you take control of a GM-controlled NPC. 
            
            <div class="divider"></div>
            
            <p><span class="numberspan">RULE 14.</span> If you're discussing a mature or otherwise disturbing topic in your roleplay, it's heavily 
            preferred you appropriately tag it at the beginning of the post. Members are flatly <span class="highlight">disallowed from 
            roleplaying sexual abuse and domestic violence.</span>
            
            <div class="divider"></div>
            
            <p><span class="numberspan">RULE 15.</span> Roleplayers are not their characters! It's expected that you're able to maintain enough of 
            a separation from your character that you don't feel emotionally affected by IC conflict, and that you don't conflate a character's 
            actions or thoughts with those of their roleplayer.
