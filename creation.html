        <div class="titlebox">WHO IS MY CHARACTER?</div>
        <div class="boxbody">Quite simply, <span class="highlight">you can be anyone you want to be!</span> The Milky Way is a huge 
          place full of limitless opportunity and plenty of strange phenomena, things that may or may not 
          be fully understood. Your character can be anyone and anything you can think of that wouldn't 
          make the genre lean on fantasy (so no wizards!). 
          <div class="dividerpostbox" style="height:12px;"></div>
          Alien hybrids, androids trying to learn what 
          it means to have emotion, a marine xenobotanist who just wants to earn prestige and the respect of their 
          peers, a bounty hunter chasing down a being that warps the laws of physics — get creative with 
          it! <span class="highlight">You're free to invent as much about the setting as you like,</span> including places, history, wars, 
          species, flora & fauna, anything.
          <p>The only mandatory hook is that you work on one of two ships, controlled by two separate factions: 
          The <span class="highlight">CTV Houdini's Ghost,</span> a long range recon ship for the Coalition, or the <span class="highlight">RSV Fireside Chat,</span> 
          a Rebellion science ship carrying valuable data. It's not required that your character feel 
          strongly either way about the war or their cause; they could've been in it for the pay, the 
          opportunity to be on a starship, the possibility of research grants or fame, whatever else you 
          can come up with. Whatever the reason, they're there!</div>

          <div class="boxdivider"></div>

          <div class="titlebox">THE VISUAL APPLICATION</div>
          <div class="boxbody">Here's where you can show us exactly how your character looks! Art on the application 
            should be at least waist-up. It doesn't have to be anything particularly cleaned or extravagant; 
            so long as it gives a clear enough picture of how your character looks, it's fine.

            <p>When it comes to clothing, humanoids from the Rebellion will have uniforms corresponding to their departments, 
            while humanoids from the Coalition will probably have whatever they could get their hands on. Non-humanoid body 
            plans will probably have niche, specialized wear dependant on their race and job, which you're free to design yourself!
            For a more in-depth look at what people will probably be wearing, see our page on 
            <span class="highlight"><a href="https://spacecrawl.github.io/site/dresscode">clothing.</a></span></p>

            <p>The completed visual application should be submitted to DeviantArt

            <p>You get <span class="highlight">one free tier</span> in one of two skills, depending on what department you're in.

              communications, and making the tough decisions. The prosperity and safety of

                secondary figure of authority that the captain can count on to manage smaller matters. In the event

                  <div class="seppad"><p>In no other department are tensions between Coalition and Rebellion members as severe as they are in security. Where the Rebellion engineer might've simply enjoyed the stream of new projects and the Coalition scientist might've just been in it for research grants, all crew in security were soldiers who pledged their lives and loyalty to their cause: protecting their faction's interests and eliminating the enemy. Though many security members would love nothing more than to shoot and punch each other like they would otherwise, unusual circumstances have forced them to set aside their differences and work together for a change.

                   <p>Security is the largest department on the ship by far, owing largely to the fact that it's two ship's military branches haphazardly smashed together. While each force's job was once simply to repel boarding crews and engage the enemy should the need arise, they now offer general tactical service and compose the main body of away teams.

                    duties of a regular soldier, their job is to deal with reports of crime and misconduct, ensure 
                    their juniors keep in shape, and coordinate security efforts during a crisis.

                        <p>When they're not getting dragged along on away missions or acting at the behest of their superiors, enlisted ranks are nothing more than glorified assistants for the rest of the ship. You can expect to see enlisted personnel cleaning the floors, handling cargo, cooking meals, and taking on other menial tasks that aren't specific to any one department. When shit hits the fan, they're expected to follow orders and defer to the tempered judgement of those in security with commissioned ranks.

                         Their most important task is making sure the ship's engines are outputting power at a steady rate.

              <div class="titlebox">RANKS</div>
              <div class="boxbody">Two crewmen might have the same job, but that doesn't mean they hold the same sway on the ship. Someone with considerable experience in their field is likely to have a promotion or two up on a newcomer - this is reflected in our ranking system, based off of military pay grades, albeit simplified and changed around a bit.
                <div class="parasep"></div>

 <p>               <span class="highlight">There are two separate categories of pay grades: enlisted (E-) and officer (O-).</span> Crew who are enlisted likely volunteered for service, or in the case of the Rebellion, may have been drafted. In contrast, officers are commissioned, meaning they were <span class="highlight">specifically sought out and offered their rank</span> by their military. Thus, <span class="highlight">the lowest officer rank (O-1) is higher than the highest enlisted rank (E-4).</span>
  <div class="parasep"></div>

     Your character can be any rank from E-1 to O-6, granted the slot is open. Grades O-4 and above represent positions in charge of departments, followed by the mantle of the first mate and the captain's chair respectively. O-1 to O-3 are pilots, bridge officers, or high-up members of security. Because having an officer pay grade represents having gotten the attention of the top brass, <span class="highlight">slots for officers are limited,</span> whereas enlisted ranks are always open.
    <div class="parasep"></div>

                <p>           Starting out, most crew will be E-1 or E-2, but your character will encounter several opportunities for promotion along the course of the campaign.
                  <div class="parasep"></div>

    When the RSV Fireside Chat crew assimilated with the CRV Houdini's Ghost, all kept their original ranks except Rebellion officers O-4 and above. In the case of Rebellion O-4s, aka department heads, only one current department head may have Rebellion origins. The rest have Coalition origins, and were assigned their positions on the Houdini's Ghost before the incident <span class="highlight"><a href="https://spacecrawl.github.io/site/world">(see our prologue).</a></span> 
                    <div class="parasep"></div>

                <p>        Former Rebellion department heads either died in the incident, or downgraded to O-3 and presently serve under their Coalition counterparts as regular doctors, engineers, scientists, or lieutenants. <span class="highlight">Members may elect to make these characters or kill them off in their backstory.</span> Both side's original first mates are deceased, leading to the current arrangement of the former Rebellion captain as the current first mate.
